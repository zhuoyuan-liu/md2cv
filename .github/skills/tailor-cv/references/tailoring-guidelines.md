# CV Tailoring Guidelines

## Section-Level Strategy

| Section | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| **Name / Contact** | Always keep verbatim. Never modify. |
| **Summary / About Me** | Rewrite to 2-3 sentences emphasizing alignment with the JD. Mention the most relevant skills and domain experience the JD calls for. |
| **Experience** | Keep the most relevant roles with 3-5 bullets each. Less relevant roles get 1-2 bullets. Drop roles with no relevance to save space. Prioritize recency. |
| **Skills** | Reorder to front-load skills mentioned in the JD. Remove skills irrelevant to the role unless they demonstrate useful breadth. |
| **Education** | Keep all degrees. Drop details (GPA, coursework) if space is tight, unless the JD specifically asks for them. |
| **Certifications** | Keep those relevant to the JD. Drop others if space is tight. |
| **Publications / Awards** | Include only if relevant to the role or if the position is academic/research-oriented. |
| **Projects** | Include only those demonstrating skills the JD requires. |

## Bullet Point Prioritization

For each experience entry:

1. **Score each bullet** against the JD requirements (internally — do not show scores in output).
2. **Keep 3-5 bullets** per highly relevant role, **1-2 bullets** per supporting role.
3. **Reword bullets** to use JD terminology where truthful. Example: if the JD says "CI/CD pipelines" and the full CV says "deployment automation", use "CI/CD pipelines".
4. **Lead with impact**: start bullets with quantified results where possible ("Reduced latency by 40%", "Processed 5TB/day"). Only claim leadership (e.g., "Led a team of 8") if the full CV explicitly states it — otherwise prefer "Worked in a team of 8" or "Contributed to a team of 8".
5. **Match the job level**, but stay honest about the candidate's actual role:
   - For senior/lead roles: emphasize leadership, architecture, mentorship, cross-team impact — but only if the full CV supports these claims.
   - For IC roles: emphasize technical depth, specific technologies, measurable output.

## Length Targets

| Experience Level | Target Length | Markdown Lines |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| < 5 years relevant experience | 1 page | ~40-80 lines |
| 5+ years or senior/principal/VP | Up to 2 pages | ~80-140 lines |

Important:
- **Pre-trim content** to fit naturally. Do not rely on md2cv's auto-fit shrinkage for major overflow — heavy shrinkage produces unreadable text.
- md2cv's auto-fit will handle minor overflow (a few lines past 1 page), but the generated content should be close to the target already.

## Content Integrity Rules

- **Never fabricate** experience, skills, or achievements not present in the full CV.
- **Rewording is allowed** — rephrasing bullets to use JD terminology is fine as long as the meaning is truthful.
- **Consolidation is allowed** — merging two related bullets into one is fine.
- **Reordering is allowed** — sections and bullets can be reordered for emphasis.
- **Dropping content is the primary mechanism** — tailoring is mostly about selecting the right subset, not rewriting everything.

## Writing Style Rules

- **Never use arrow symbols** (`→`, `->`, `=>`, `»`) in CV content. Use plain dashes (`-`) or colons instead.
- **Never use emoji** or Unicode decorative symbols.
- **Avoid AI-favored filler phrases** such as "Spearheaded", "Leveraged", "Utilized", "Orchestrated", "Synergized", "Cutting-edge", "Best-in-class", "Drove innovation". Prefer plain, direct language.
- **Use natural, human-sounding language.** Write the way a real person would describe their work. For example: "Built" instead of "Architected", "Improved" instead of "Optimized", "Worked with" instead of "Collaborated cross-functionally with".
- **Keep bullet points factual and specific.** State what was done and the measurable result. Avoid vague claims like "significantly improved performance".
- **Do not exaggerate the level of responsibility or ownership.** Use verbs that honestly reflect the candidate's actual role. Prefer "Engaged in", "Contributed to", "Participated in", "Supported" over inflated claims like "Led", "Drove", "Owned", "Pioneered" — unless the full CV explicitly states a leadership or ownership role. It is fine to subtly enhance language (e.g., "Helped build" → "Contributed to building"), but do not promote a contributor to a leader. The CV should impress through substance and results, not inflated titles or verbs.

## Keyword Optimization

- Extract key requirements, technologies, and qualifications from the JD.
- Ensure the tailored CV mentions these keywords naturally within experience bullets and the skills section.
- Do not keyword-stuff — every mention should be backed by actual experience from the full CV.
